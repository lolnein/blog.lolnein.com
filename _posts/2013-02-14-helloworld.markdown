title: Hello World

Today is the official start of my web comic ‘lolnein’ and I am very
excited to present my work to you.

As I am not a native speaker of the English language, please forgive
my potentially odd use of it.
I hope that it will not diminish your amusement.

I prepared several comics in advance, although I have only published
five of them for now.
If everything works as planned, I am going to publish at least one
more of them a week.

Enjoy!
