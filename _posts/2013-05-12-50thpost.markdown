Hey guys! I have just uploaded the 50th post on lolnein.com. 
The webcomic got more and more popular since it went online in February 2013. 
You guys shared it and spread the word.
Thank you so much! 
I am happy about every like on my Facebook page and every comment on my website. 
And I hope you keep on supporting me because I have plans for the future:

First of all, the website still needs some adjustments. Sometimes the fonts change and sometimes the entire page goes Picasso. If you have suggestions how to make lolnein.com a better place just drop me a line.

Secondly, I will provide more products in my shop.

And thirdly, there is going to be another little animation. 
But because it takes a really long time to make one I will wait until some more people are following lolnein.com. 
So tell your friends and strangers on the train about it.

lolnein is on the rise!

And add the word "lolnein" to your active vocabulary.
