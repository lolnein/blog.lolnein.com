Hey!
As you may know, I am trying to draw at least one comic per day 
(and I hope they still entertain you).
But it feels like there is no progress at the moment. 
Either I am just an impatient little guy or I am doing something wrong.
Maybe you have an idea how lolnein can get more attention.
If so, drop me a line.

Thanks a lot!
