title: German Twitter Account
---

I have created a German Twitter account which I will use for random brain farts in my mother tongue. 

So if you speak German, [follow me](https://twitter.com/lolnein_de]). 

If not, learn German and then [follow me](https://twitter.com/lolnein_de). 

Or just pretend you speak German and [follow me](https://twitter.com/lolnein_de).


Thank you for your attention!
