title: It's Fan Mail!
---

Guess what I found when I checked my postbox today? (PSST YOU DON'T HAVE TO GUESS THE TITLE ALREADY SAYS IT)

So I got my first fan mail and it made my day!
It is a nice little postcard and it has a cute little drawing on it, too!
Look at those high quality photos I took!

Thank you so much [Lisa](http://lisasbasket.tumblr.com)!

I just want you folks to know that I really appreciate those things. Postcards, letters, e-mails, comments, and little gifts like a WiiU or several million euro.

Have a nice day!
