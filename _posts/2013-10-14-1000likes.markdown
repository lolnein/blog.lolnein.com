You. Are. Awesome.

So yesterday the lolnein Facebook page reached 1000 likes which has been a goal since I started the webcomic.
I may have a lot more followers on Tumblr, but likes on Facebook seem to be a more precise indicator of how successful something is.
(But don't get me wrong. I love Tumblr!)


Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for liking and spreading my comics, however you do it!
