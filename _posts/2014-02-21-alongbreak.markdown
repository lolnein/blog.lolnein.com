title: A Long Break
---

So it took me over a month to create a new comic.
What happened to the lolnein that updated every few days?
The answer is really simple and not really worth a blog entry.
But I wanted you to know that I am sorry I left you waiting for quite some time without giving any information on what is happening.

 
I had other things on my mind. 
Not immensely important things. 
Just ... things, you know?
Every attempt to think of something funny failed miserably and demotivated me even more.
So I had no ideas. 
And I had no motivation to draw. 
That's because I am extremely unsatisifed with the drawings. 
I wanted to change the art style and caused me to completely lose momentum. 
I still haven't found a style I want to work with. 
So expect the next comics to look a bit different.
And yes, of course I will try to update more often again!
To make you smile.
To make you happy.
Because I love you.


Have a nice day!
