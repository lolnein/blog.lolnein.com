title: How to get your point across
---

Once I stumbled over an altered version of my comic [Ew, shit](https://lolnein.com/2013/06/03/ewshit/). After a little research I found a few different versions.
Then one day, someone mentioned in the comment section of my comic that he has seen "this image being used a million times".
So I checked again and found a lot more than last time:

These are the ones I found on the internet. They do not necessarily reflect my opinion.

Ha! I think it is quite amusing (and I feel a bit flattered!).
The guy in the comments also mentioned how "each one gets worse in quality" so I decided to redo it. So if you wish to tell someone in a really immature, provocative way what you think of something, here you go:

If you like to keep it simple:

If you would like to make your own:

Thank you and have a nice day!
